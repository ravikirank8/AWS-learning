🔹 What is AWS Glue DataBrew?

AWS Glue DataBrew is a visual, no-code data preparation tool that helps data analysts and data scientists clean, normalize, and transform raw data before analysis or ML training.

👉 Think of it as Excel on steroids + ETL automation, but serverless and scalable.

🔹 How Glue DataBrew Works

Connect Data Sources

Import data from S3, Redshift, RDS, Glue Data Catalog, DynamoDB, Salesforce, JDBC sources.

Profile the Data

Automatically scans dataset.

Identifies missing values, outliers, data types, schema mismatches.

Apply Transformations (Recipes)

Prebuilt 250+ transformations (filter, dedupe, normalize, format dates, standardize text, etc.).

Each applied step is recorded in a “recipe” (reusable, repeatable set of transformations).

Preview & Validate

Interactive, spreadsheet-like UI to test transformations before running them at scale.

Run Jobs at Scale

DataBrew executes transformations as serverless jobs.

No cluster setup (runs on AWS-managed infrastructure).

Export Results

Cleaned/normalized data written back to S3, Redshift, RDS, Snowflake, Data Catalog, etc.

Ready for Athena queries, BI dashboards, ML pipelines.

🔹 Example Workflow (Real Life)

📌 Example: Retail Company analyzing sales data

Raw sales transactions loaded into S3 (from POS systems, CSVs, APIs).

DataBrew connected to the dataset.

Analysts applied recipes to:

Remove duplicate transactions.

Convert date formats.

Standardize product categories.

Fill missing values with averages.

Transformed dataset saved into Amazon Redshift.

BI team uses QuickSight to visualize cleaned data.

ML team uses cleaned data in SageMaker for demand forecasting.

🔹 Key Features of Glue DataBrew

✅ No-code data prep → drag-and-drop UI for analysts (no Python/SQL required).

✅ 250+ built-in transformations (dedupe, normalize, enrich, encode).

✅ Reusable recipes → define once, apply at scale.

✅ Serverless → no infrastructure to manage (scales automatically).

✅ Data Profiling → detect anomalies, missing values, schema mismatches.

✅ Integration with AWS services → S3, Redshift, RDS, Glue Catalog, DynamoDB.

✅ Collaboration → multiple team members can share and reuse recipes.

✅ Monitoring & Auditing → via CloudWatch, CloudTrail.

🔹 Solutions Architect Exam Focus

DataBrew is not for ETL orchestration (that’s Glue ETL).

DataBrew is not for big data batch compute (that’s EMR/Spark).

DataBrew is not for real-time streaming (that’s Kinesis/MSK).

DataBrew is best when:

Business analysts/non-technical users need to clean data.

Preparing data for BI dashboards (QuickSight, Athena).

Preprocessing datasets for ML pipelines.

Standardizing datasets before putting into Redshift, S3 Data Lake, or Glue Data Catalog.

👉 Key Exam Tip: If the scenario says “a business analyst needs to prepare data without coding” → answer is Glue DataBrew.
