🔍 What is AWS EventBridge?
AWS EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that helps you build scalable, decoupled, event-driven applications by routing real-time data from AWS services, SaaS platforms, and custom applications.

It is an evolution of Amazon CloudWatch Events with additional features like schema registry, event buses, and integration with third-party apps (e.g., Zendesk, Datadog).

🧱 Components of AWS EventBridge
| Component           | Purpose                                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Event Bus**       | Logical channel to receive and route events (Default, Custom, Partner) |
| **Rules**           | Match incoming events to trigger actions                               |
| **Targets**         | AWS services or APIs invoked by matching rules                         |
| **Events**          | JSON payloads representing changes/actions                             |
| **Schema Registry** | Stores event structure, helps with type validation                     |
| **Event Sources**   | AWS services, SaaS apps, custom apps (via SDK/API)                     |

🔍 Final Exam Tips – EventBridge vs. Others
| Scenario                                                | Service to Choose |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Need to trigger Lambda from CloudWatch alert            | **EventBridge**   |
| React to SaaS app event like Zendesk ticket creation    | **EventBridge**   |
| Need durable queue and decoupling                       | **SQS**           |
| Need simple broadcast                                   | **SNS**           |
| Need orchestration of events from multiple AWS accounts | **EventBridge**   |
| Need FIFO queueing with strict ordering                 | **SQS FIFO**      |
| Need content-based routing                              | **EventBridge**   |



🤝 Tightly Coupled vs. Distributed (Loosely Coupled) Applications
| Property       | Tightly Coupled                | Loosely Coupled (Distributed)       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Integration    | Services know about each other | Services don’t depend on each other |
| Communication  | Direct (API calls)             | Indirect (events, queues)           |
| Scalability    | Harder to scale                | Easily scalable                     |
| Failure Impact | High (chain reaction)          | Low (isolated)                      |
| Flexibility    | Difficult to change            | Easy to add/remove services         |

📌 Why It Matters
EventBridge enables loose coupling by publishing events, not making direct service calls.

This improves scalability, fault tolerance, and agility in cloud-native designs.

📌 Exam Tip:
If the scenario says: “Need to decouple services or improve system fault tolerance”, EventBridge is likely the answer.

✅ What is AWS EventBridge?
Imagine EventBridge as a smart event organizer at a huge conference.

People (services) from different companies (AWS, SaaS apps, or your own custom apps) send announcements (events) to this organizer.

The organizer listens, checks who needs to be notified, and sends the message to the right room (target service like Lambda, SQS, etc.).

The organizer doesn't care who sent the event — they just route it intelligently based on predefined rules.

It helps apps talk to each other without directly knowing each other — making systems loosely coupled, more scalable, and easier to manage.
