ðŸš€ What is AWS VPC?
AWS VPC is like building your own private data center inside AWS Cloud.

You decide:

What IP address range to use (like the street address for your network)

How many rooms (subnets) to create

Who can enter which room (security rules)

Who can access the internet, and how

AWS gives you a big, empty space (a VPC), and you design how everything connects and communicates.
