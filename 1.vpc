🚀 What is AWS VPC?

AWS VPC is like building your own private data center inside AWS Cloud.

You decide:

What IP address range to use (like the street address for your network)

How many rooms (subnets) to create

Who can enter which room (security rules)

Who can access the internet, and how

AWS gives you a big, empty space (a VPC), and you design how everything connects and communicates.

classless Inter-Domain Routing

🧱 Components of VPC (Plain Technical Explanation)
1. VPC CIDR Block
It’s the IP range you reserve for your network, like 10.0.0.0/16.

This tells AWS: “Give me 65,536 private IP addresses to work with.”

👉 This is your full network space.

2. Subnets
You break your VPC into smaller sections called subnets.

Two main types:

Public Subnet: Can talk to the internet

Private Subnet: Cannot talk to the internet directly

👉 Think of public subnet like a lobby, and private subnet like a locked office room.

3. Route Tables
These are the rules for how traffic flows inside your VPC.

Example: Public subnet has a rule to send internet traffic to the Internet Gateway.

👉 Like a GPS that tells where traffic should go.

4. Internet Gateway (IGW)
This is the door that connects your VPC to the internet.

Needed if your servers (like a website) need to be accessible from the outside world.

👉 Think of it as your VPC’s front gate to the internet.

5. NAT Gateway
NAT means "Network Address Translation".

It allows private servers to access the internet (for software updates), but blocks incoming connections from the internet.

👉 Like a one-way door: inside servers can go out, but outsiders can’t come in.

6. Security Groups
These are like firewalls attached to individual servers.

They decide who can talk to your server and on what ports.

👉 Like giving each server its own visitor list.

7. Network ACLs
These are firewalls for subnets (groups of servers).

They can block traffic from certain IPs or allow only specific ones.

👉 Like a building entrance that checks every visitor.

8. Elastic IP
A static public IP address that doesn’t change.

You assign this to things like a NAT Gateway or a Bastion Host.

👉 Like reserving a permanent phone number for your server.

9. Bastion Host
A special EC2 server in the public subnet that you can SSH into.

From there, you connect to private servers inside your VPC.

👉 Like a security checkpoint: you enter here before going inside.

10. VPC Peering
Connect two VPCs privately.

Servers in both VPCs can talk to each other using internal IPs.

👉 Like connecting two offices with a private tunnel.

11. Transit Gateway
A central router that connects multiple VPCs and even on-premises data centers.

Better than peering if you have lots of VPCs.

👉 Like a highway junction for many roads.

12. VPC Endpoints
Allows your VPC to access AWS services like S3, DynamoDB without using the internet.

👉 Like creating a private door from your office to the AWS service building.

13. PrivateLink
Lets you privately access services in another VPC (even another AWS account), without going over the internet.

👉 Like a direct fiber cable between two buildings inside AWS.

14. VPC Flow Logs
These capture all the network activity in your VPC.

Useful for troubleshooting and security audits.

👉 Like CCTV logs of who entered and exited your office.
