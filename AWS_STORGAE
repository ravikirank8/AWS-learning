üî∑ 1. BLOCK STORAGE
Block storage divides data into fixed-size blocks and stores them individually. Each block has its own unique address and can be accessed directly (without a file path).

Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)

‚û§ Use Cases:
Databases (SQL/NoSQL) ‚Äì MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
Boot volumes for EC2 Linux/Windows
Transactional workloads with high IOPS requirements (e.g., financial systems)
Low-latency access for block-level apps

‚û§ When to Pick:
When performance and low latency are critical
When you need to attach storage to an individual EC2 instance
For stateful applications that require disk-like behavior

‚û§ Key Features:
Low-latency access
Persistent, durable storage
Attached to a single EC2 instance at a time (like a virtual hard disk)
Supports SSD and HDD-backed volumes
Offers snapshots, encryption, IOPS provisioning

‚û§ Pros:
‚úÖ High performance and low latency
‚úÖ Fine-grained control over data (especially needed by databases and OS-level apps)
‚úÖ Persistent storage even after EC2 termination (if configured)

‚û§ Cons:
‚ùå Tightly coupled to EC2 ‚Äì can't share easily between instances
‚ùå Limited scalability ‚Äì storage is constrained to instance size and EBS limits
‚ùå Not natively accessible over a network like shared file systems

================

üî∑ 2. FILE STORAGE (File System-based)
‚û§ Definition:
File storage uses a hierarchical structure (folders/directories/files). It‚Äôs accessible over network protocols like NFS, SMB, and allows shared access.

Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) ‚Äì Linux-based

Amazon FSx:
FSx for Windows File Server ‚Äì for SMB/Windows apps
FSx for Lustre ‚Äì for high-performance computing


‚û§ Use Cases:
Web servers sharing media or code
Content management systems (CMS)
Shared home directories
Lift-and-shift Windows applications using FSx for Windows
High-performance computing (HPC) with FSx for Lustre

‚û§ When to Pick:
When multiple compute instances need shared access
When you're using legacy applications expecting file system semantics
For machine learning, media rendering, or dev/test environments

‚û§ Key Features:
Shared, concurrent access
Standard POSIX or SMB file system interface
Managed scalability
Integrated with on-premises or hybrid architectures

‚û§ Pros:
‚úÖ Multiple EC2 instances can share the same file system
‚úÖ Familiar file/directory structure for apps
‚úÖ Managed scalability (especially EFS)
‚úÖ Elastic ‚Äì grow/shrink as needed
‚úÖ Cross-AZ mountable (EFS)

‚û§ Cons:
‚ùå Higher latency than block storage
‚ùå More expensive than object storage
‚ùå Protocol-dependent performance limitations (NFS/SMB)

===================

‚û§ Definition:
Object storage manages data as objects ‚Äì each with metadata and a unique identifier. It's flat, not hierarchical. Accessed via HTTP APIs (e.g., REST, SDKs).

‚û§ AWS Service:
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

‚û§ Use Cases:
Backup and archival
Big data and analytics
Static web content hosting
Media delivery (video, images)
Data lake storage
IoT data ingestion
Serverless applications

‚û§ When to Pick:
When you need internet-accessible, cost-effective, and highly scalable storage
For unstructured data (images, logs, videos)
If lifecycle management and storage tiering are priorities
When you want to build event-driven or serverless architectures


‚û§ Key Features:
Infinitely scalable storage

Global namespace via unique object keys

Built-in versioning, encryption, lifecycle policies

Event-driven (integrates with Lambda, SNS, SQS)

Supports storage classes for cost optimization

‚û§ Storage Classes:
S3 Standard

S3 Intelligent-Tiering

S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)

S3 One Zone-IA

S3 Glacier / Glacier Deep Archive (for archival)

‚û§ Pros:
‚úÖ Highly scalable & durable (11 9s durability)
‚úÖ Built for internet-scale data sharing
‚úÖ Native integration with analytics & AI/ML tools
‚úÖ Lifecycle policies reduce costs automatically
‚úÖ Supports static website hosting

‚û§ Cons:
‚ùå Not suitable for traditional OS-level applications
‚ùå Higher latency ‚Äì not built for transactional I/O
‚ùå Requires apps to handle object-based access patterns


==============

‚úÖ Choosing the Right Storage ‚Äì Architect's View:
Scenario	Choose
Need fast, consistent latency for DB	Block (EBS)
Shared file system for EC2s or HPC workloads	File (EFS or FSx)
Internet-scale web content / backup	Object (S3)
Store logs, images, video at low cost	Object (S3 + Glacier)
Legacy Windows apps requiring SMB	FSx for Windows
ML workloads needing high-speed file access	FSx for Lustre
Mountable file storage with elasticity	EFS
