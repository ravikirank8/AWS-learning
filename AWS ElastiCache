üöÄ What Is AWS ElastiCache?
ElastiCache is a fully managed in-memory caching service for Redis and Memcached.

AWS manages the underlying infrastructure (nodes, scaling, patching, backups), so you focus only on how your app uses the cache.

üß† Real-Life Analogy
ElastiCache = Coffee Thermos

Instead of brewing a new pot (querying the database) every time, you store hot coffee (data) in a thermos (cache) ‚Äî instant access, no wait time, and no load on the coffee machine (DB).

üß© Core Components of ElastiCache
| Component             | Description                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Node**              | A single cache instance (memory + CPU)              |
| **Cluster**           | One or more nodes working together                  |
| **Replication Group** | Used in Redis for replication and high availability |
| **Shards**            | Partitioning data across multiple nodes (Redis)     |
| **Endpoints**         | DNS names to connect to primary or replica nodes    |

üß† Solution Architect Exam Considerations
‚úÖ Use Redis when you need:

Data persistence

High availability / failover

Advanced data types

Cross-region replication

‚úÖ Use Memcached when you need:

Simpler, memory-only cache

High throughput and low complexity

No need for persistence or replication

‚ùå Don‚Äôt use ElastiCache when:

You require strong consistency across regions (use DynamoDB)

You want persistent storage with relational querying (use RDS/Redshift)

üß© What Is ElastiCache for Memcached?
Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached is a fully managed, in-memory caching service based on the Memcached engine.

It is ideal for simple, high-performance, ephemeral (non-persistent) key-value caching, such as:

Caching query results,

Offloading session state storage,

Reducing latency on frequently accessed data.

‚úÖ Why Use Memcached?
üî∏ Use Case Characteristics:
No persistence required (data loss on restart is acceptable)

No replication or automatic failover needed

Scale-out (horizontal scaling) is critical

You need simple key-value lookups (strings only)
