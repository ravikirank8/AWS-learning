‚úÖ What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?
Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offered by AWS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications in the cloud without worrying about the infrastructure (servers, load balancers, scaling, etc.).

‚úÖ 6. Summary from Solution Architect View


| Area                  | Elastic Beanstalk Role                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Deployment**        | Upload `.jar` or `.war`; no infrastructure code needed |
| **Infrastructure**    | Automatically provisions EC2, ELB, scaling groups      |
| **Resilience**        | Built-in auto-scaling and load balancing               |
| **Security**          | Can run in VPC, use IAM roles, connect to RDS securely |
| **Monitoring & Logs** | CloudWatch integration, environment health dashboard   |
| **CI/CD**             | Integrates with CodePipeline for automated deployments |



AWS Elastic Beanstalk automates:

Provisioning: Creating the servers, databases, networking

Deployment: Upload your code and it will run it

Load balancing: Manages traffic automatically

Auto-scaling: Scales the number of servers up/down based on demand

Monitoring: Gives health and performance reports

üéØ Purpose of Elastic Beanstalk
Simplifies web application deployment

Allows developers to focus on writing code, not infrastructure

Supports many languages/platforms (Java, .NET, Python, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, Go, Docker, etc.)

Provides full control if you need it (you can customize environments)

üìç Where to Use It
Use Elastic Beanstalk when:

You are building a web application or API

You want to deploy your app quickly without managing infrastructure

You want auto-scaling, load balancing, and monitoring built-in

You have a standard web app architecture (frontend/backend)


If you need fine-grained control over containers or microservices, consider Amazon ECS or EKS.

But if your team is small and you need rapid deployment for a single web app, Elastic Beanstalk is ideal.
