What is a VPN in AWS?
VPN (Virtual Private Network) in AWS is used to securely connect your on-premises network or another cloud to your AWS VPC over the internet.

Think of it as a private tunnel through the public internet.

🎯 Why Use VPN?
| Use Case                | Description                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hybrid cloud setup**  | Connect your data center to AWS                       |
| **Secure access**       | Encrypt traffic between AWS and external networks     |
| **Temporary extension** | Bridge on-prem to cloud until full migration          |
| **Cost-effective**      | Much cheaper than dedicated lines like Direct Connect |

🧱 VPN Architecture Overview
💡 Key Components:
| Component                         | Role                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Customer Gateway (CGW)**        | Your side (on-prem device or software)                            |
| **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)** | AWS side – sits at the edge of your VPC                           |
| **VPN Connection**                | Logical connection between CGW and VGW                            |
| **VPC**                           | Your private cloud network on AWS                                 |
| **Tunnel**                        | IPSec-encrypted path over the internet (2 tunnels for redundancy) |

✅ You define routing so that traffic to your AWS VPC goes through this secure tunnel.

🔁 VPN Routing Options
AWS supports two routing types for VPN:

1️⃣ Static Routing
You manually enter IP prefixes (CIDR blocks) of your on-prem network.

Used when your device doesn’t support BGP.

2️⃣ Dynamic Routing (BGP)
AWS and your CGW exchange routes dynamically using BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).

Auto adapts to changes and is preferred for large or flexible environments.

🧠 Solution Architect’s Note:
Use BGP where possible — improves high availability and reduces config errors.


💸 VPN Pricing (As of Aug 2025 – double-check current AWS docs)
Pricing Component	Cost
VPN connection	$0.05 per hour ($36/month) per connection
Data transfer	Charged per GB (based on standard AWS data transfer rates)

⚠️ You are not charged for both tunnels — but only the active data transfer and connection hours.


🚦 Gateway Limits

| **VPN tunnels per connection**          | 2                            | ❌ Fixed                             |
| **Throughput per VPN tunnel**           | \~1.25 Gbps (non-guaranteed) | ❌ No (but aggregate across tunnels) |

🔐 VPN High Availability
AWS creates 2 VPN tunnels per connection by default:

Use both tunnels in your CGW config for failover.

AWS manages tunnel health — if one fails, traffic flows through the second.

Best practice: configure both tunnels on the customer side for automatic failover.

🧠 Solution Architect Considerations
| Question                                      | Best Practice                                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Need consistent high bandwidth?               | Consider **AWS Direct Connect** or **VPN + DX**            |
| Want automatic routing failover?              | Use **BGP (Dynamic Routing)**                              |
| Is VPN a long-term solution?                  | No – VPN is ideal for **temporary or backup** connectivity |
| Need encrypted traffic between multiple VPCs? | Use **Transit Gateway + VPN**                              |
| Need to connect to multiple AWS regions?      | Use **Cloud WAN or TGW with VPN**                          |
| Using third-party firewall appliances?        | Consider **software-based CGW like pfSense**               |
