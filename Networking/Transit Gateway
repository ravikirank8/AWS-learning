üß≠ Summary
Use VPC Peering for small setups where only a few VPCs need to talk to each other.
Use Transit Gateway for large-scale and hybrid architectures with multiple VPCs, VPNs, or DX connections.
Use Direct Connect when high bandwidth, low latency, or secure connectivity to your on-premises environment is required.


üöÄ What is AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)?
AWS Transit Gateway is a network transit hub that connects VPCs, on-premises networks, and other AWS services through a single gateway.

‚úÖ It supports transitive routing and centralized control, solving all scalability issues of VPC peering.

üß† Key Concepts
| Concept               | Description                                                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attachment**        | A connection between a VPC or VPN and the Transit Gateway             |
| **Route Table**       | Each TGW has its own route tables; VPCs can use specific route tables |
| **Propagation**       | Automatically adds routes to the TGW route table                      |
| **Association**       | Tells TGW which route table to use for the attachment                 |
| **Domain Isolation**  | You can control who talks to whom using route tables                  |
| **Multicast support** | For real-time apps (VoIP, media streaming)                            |
| **Cross-account**     | Yes, through **AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)**                    |

üîó Connecting On-Premises Networks to TGW
You can attach on-premises to TGW via:

| Method                                | Use Case                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **VPN (IPSec)**                       | Site-to-site connection                        |
| **AWS Direct Connect Gateway (DXGW)** | Dedicated private connection                   |
| **SD-WAN appliances**                 | 3rd-party integrations (e.g., Cisco, Aviatrix) |
üß† This means you can connect data centers ‚Üí TGW ‚Üí all VPCs.

üîÅ Transit Gateway Peering (TGW Peering)
Allows TGW-to-TGW connection across regions/accounts

Works over AWS backbone ‚Äì not over the internet

Fully managed & encrypted

Use case: Global architectures (e.g., US ‚Üî India)
