üîπ What is It?
AWS Global Accelerator (GA) improves global application availability and performance by routing user traffic through the AWS global network, not the public internet, to reach your application endpoints.

üîπ Why Use Global Accelerator?
| Benefit                                | Explanation                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üåç **Global Anycast IPs**              | Single static IP addresses that route users to the nearest healthy endpoint |
| üöÄ **Improved Performance**            | Uses AWS backbone for faster and predictable routing                        |
| üîÅ **Automatic Failover**              | Detects unhealthy endpoints and reroutes to healthy ones instantly          |
| üìà **Low Latency & High Availability** | Improves global connectivity for both TCP and UDP apps                      |
üîπ How Global Accelerator Works
You get 2 static Anycast IPs

User connects to the nearest AWS edge location

Traffic is routed via AWS private backbone to your regional endpoint (ALB, NLB, EC2, or EIP)

If one region/endpoint fails, traffic is rerouted instantly

‚úÖ CloudFront vs Global Accelerator ‚Äì Key Differences
| Feature               | CloudFront                               | Global Accelerator                       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Use Case**          | Static/dynamic content delivery (CDN)    | Global application acceleration          |
| **Traffic Type**      | HTTP/HTTPS                               | TCP/UDP                                  |
| **Routing**           | Edge cache-based routing                 | Network-level routing via AWS backbone   |
| **Caching**           | Yes (edge caching for performance)       | No caching ‚Äì direct acceleration         |
| **Static IP Support** | ‚ùå No (Uses DNS-based routing)            | ‚úÖ Yes (Anycast IPs)                      |
| **Failover**          | Limited (only regional/Edge)             | Global failover between multiple regions |
| **Protocol Support**  | HTTP/S only                              | HTTP/S + TCP + UDP                       |
| **Best For**          | Static assets, websites, video streaming | Gaming, VoIP, APIs, low-latency apps     |

üìå Exam Tips (AWS Certified Solutions Architect)
‚úÖ Use Global Accelerator when:

You need static IPs (whitelisting by enterprise firewalls)

Low latency + global failover is a must

You serve TCP/UDP traffic (e.g., game servers, voice/video apps)

You need region-level failover (active-active or active-passive)

‚úÖ Use CloudFront when:

Caching improves performance

You want to reduce origin load and cost

You serve content-heavy apps (media, web, APIs)
