üß† What is MemoryDB for Redis?
AWS MemoryDB for Redis is a durable, in-memory database service based on Redis. Unlike ElastiCache (which is mostly for caching), MemoryDB can act as both a cache and a primary database.

It offers:

Ultra-fast performance (microsecond latency)

Multi-AZ durability

Full Redis API support

High availability with failover

Data persistence using multi-AZ snapshots and replication

üöÄ Why Do You Need MemoryDB?
Common Challenges Solved:
Apps need sub-millisecond reads and high write throughput

You want to reduce infrastructure by using Redis as both cache + DB

You need Redis performance but also durability and failover

You can‚Äôt tolerate data loss ‚Äî even if a node fails

üß± Core Components of MemoryDB
| Component                       | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cluster**                     | A group of Redis nodes managed together with replication and sharding        |
| **Shard**                       | A partition of your data; can have one primary and multiple replicas         |
| **Node**                        | A Redis process (can be primary or replica)                                  |
| **Subnet Groups**               | Controls which subnets MemoryDB can use ‚Äî ensures secure and isolated access |
| **Parameter Groups**            | Engine-specific config (e.g., TTL, maxmemory-policy)                         |
| **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** | Manage users and command-level access to the database                        |
| **Snapshots**                   | Durable backups stored across Availability Zones                             |


üß† Real-Life Analogy
Imagine MemoryDB for Redis as a super-fast, writeable whiteboard in a bank vault:

It lets people write and read almost instantly (in-memory Redis),

The vault replicates the board every few seconds to another vault (durability),

If one vault burns down (node/zone failure), the other continues without downtime,

Users have different access levels: some can write, others only read (ACLs).
