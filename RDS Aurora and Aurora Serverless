‚úÖ What Is Amazon Aurora?
Amazon Aurora is a fully managed, high-performance relational database built for the cloud. It is compatible with:
MySQL
PostgreSQL

It offers the speed and availability of commercial DBs like Oracle at 1/10th the cost.

üí• Why Do We Need Aurora?
Traditional databases (on-prem or even managed like RDS) have limitations:
Performance bottlenecks during scale
Complex failover setups
Manual provisioning
High licensing costs
Aurora solves these by providing:
Auto-scaling storage
Built-in high availability (6 copies of data across 3 AZs)
Faster performance (up to 5x faster than MySQL)
Serverless option for variable workloads
Global replication

üß± Aurora Storage Architecture
| Feature                   | Aurora                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Type                      | Distributed, fault-tolerant, SSD |
| Replication               | 6 copies across 3 AZs            |
| Auto Scaling              | 10 GB ‚Üí 128 TB                   |
| Decoupled Compute/Storage | Yes                              |
| I/O Path                  | Logs directly to storage engine  |

üí° Data is written once to storage and replicated across multiple AZs ‚Äî reducing latency and boosting durability.

üß© Components of an Aurora Cluster
| Component          | Purpose                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cluster Volume** | Shared storage across all instances               |
| **Writer Node**    | Handles write/read operations (1 per cluster)     |
| **Reader Nodes**   | Read replicas (scale out read traffic)            |
| **Endpoints**      | Cluster endpoint (write) & reader endpoint (read) |

| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Scale Granularity  | 1 Aurora Capacity Unit | Fine-grained (0.5 ACU and up) |
| Scaling Speed      | Seconds to minutes     | Milliseconds                  |
| Connection Support | 100s of connections    | 1000s of connections          |
| Multi-AZ support   | No                     | Yes                           |
| Production Ready   | Limited                | **Yes (Enterprise-grade)**    |

üåç Aurora Global Database
Used for low-latency global applications, Aurora Global Database:
Replicates your DB across multiple AWS Regions
Provides cross-region disaster recovery
Writes in one region (primary), read from multiple regions
Failover to secondary region can happen in ~1 minute
