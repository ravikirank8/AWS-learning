✅ What is Amazon SES?
Amazon SES is a fully managed, scalable, and cost-effective email service designed to enable:

Email sending (transactional, bulk, marketing)

Email receiving

Delivery tracking and analytics

Compliance with authentication standards (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)

It supports SMTP and API-based email sending, ideal for applications that require reliable email communication without managing their own mail servers.

🧱 Key Components of AWS SES
| Component                    | Description                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Verified Identities**      | Domains or email addresses verified to send or receive emails. Required for SPF/DKIM/DMARC compliance.       |
| **Mail From Domain**         | Custom domain used in the MAIL FROM SMTP command. Supports bounce tracking and better branding.              |
| **Configuration Sets**       | Used to publish sending events (e.g., delivery, opens, bounces) to destinations like SNS, S3, or CloudWatch. |
| **Event Destinations**       | Targets for publishing event data: SNS (real-time), CloudWatch (monitoring), or S3 (storage/auditing).       |
| **Email Templates**          | HTML-based templates with dynamic data injection for personalization.                                        |
| **Suppression List**         | Global/shared or account-level list of addresses to suppress due to bounces/complaints.                      |
| **Dedicated IPs (optional)** | For isolating sender reputation and improving deliverability.                                                |


⚙️ How SES Works Technically
Verify Identity
Use VerifyEmailIdentity or VerifyDomainIdentity API. Domain verification supports DKIM/SPF.

Send Email

Via SMTP Interface (username/password from SES console)

Via AWS SDK / SES API (SendEmail, SendRawEmail, etc.)

Supported from EC2, Lambda, or backend applications.

Receive Email (Optional)

Configure Rule Sets to process inbound emails.

Email can be delivered to S3, Lambda, or SNS.

Useful for support systems or ticketing.

Track Events

Use Configuration Sets to attach tracking to outgoing emails.

Events: Delivery, Bounce, Complaint, Open, Click

Route via SNS/S3/CloudWatch Logs.

🧠 Tips & Tricks for the Exam
You must verify identities (email/domain) before sending.

Sandbox mode is default; request production access for real-world use.

Configuration Sets + Event Destinations = key architecture pattern.

SES supports SMTP authentication and IAM-based API access.

Expect questions on bounces/complaints handling via SNS.

Understand how SPF, DKIM, and DMARC improve deliverability.

SES can receive emails, not just send them. This supports event-driven architectures.

With Dedicated IP, reputation is isolated — useful for sensitive campaigns.
