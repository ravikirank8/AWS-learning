ðŸ”¹ 1. What is AWS EKS?
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS without managing your own control plane.

Fully managed control plane (scaling, patching, upgrades, HA).

Supports native Kubernetes (vanilla experience).

Integrates with AWS services (IAM, VPC, CloudWatch, ALB, etc.).

Can be deployed on:

EC2 (self-managed worker nodes)

Fargate (serverless compute)

On-prem (via EKS Anywhere)

ðŸ”¹ 2. EKS Architecture Overview
ðŸ”¸ Control Plane:
Managed by AWS

Runs across 3 AZs for HA

Includes etcd, API server, scheduler, controller manager

You donâ€™t pay per EC2 instance for control plane

ðŸ”¸ Worker Nodes:
Self-managed EC2 (via Node Groups)

Managed Node Groups (auto-scaling, lifecycle management)

Fargate (serverless, pay-per-pod)


ðŸ”¹ 3. When to Use EKS (vs ECS)
| **Use EKS when**                         | **Use ECS when**                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| You need **Kubernetes portability**      | You want **AWS-native simplicity**  |
| Teams have **Kubernetes expertise**      | Teams want **minimal ops overhead** |
| Hybrid/multi-cloud required              | Fully on AWS                        |
| Need custom scheduling/pod-level control | Task-level simplicity is enough     |
| Third-party Kubernetes tooling           | Tight AWS integration only          |


ðŸ”¹ 4. Production-Ready Considerations for EKS
âœ… Cluster Setup
Use Private VPC Endpoints for control plane

Enable Logging (API, audit, controller logs to CloudWatch)

Separate Dev/Prod clusters or use Namespaces with strict RBAC

âœ… Security
Use IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) for least privilege access

Implement RBAC for granular user access

Use Pod Security Policies or OPA/Gatekeeper

Enable Secrets encryption using KMS

âœ… Networking
Choose between VPC CNI, Calico, or Cilium

Plan for IP exhaustion (each pod gets a VPC IP with VPC CNI)

Use ENIConfig for multi-subnet allocation

âœ… Scalability
Use Cluster Autoscaler for EC2

Use Karpenter for smarter, faster node provisioning

Fargate profiles for serverless, smaller workloads

âœ… Monitoring & Logging
Use CloudWatch Container Insights, Prometheus/Grafana

Use Fluent Bit or Fluentd for logs

Set up Alerts for node/pod failures, high CPU, memory

ðŸŸ¨ EKS is more expensive if you're using many small clusters. ECS is cheaper and simpler, but less flexible.
