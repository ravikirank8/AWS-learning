📍 Where to Use Each – Solution Architect View
🟢 Elastic Beanstalk
Use When:

You need fast deployment of a Java, Python, Node.js, PHP, .NET web app

Your app is monolithic or simple 2-3 tier

Your team is not deeply experienced in cloud infrastructure

You want managed EC2 + scaling + monitoring

Avoid When:

You are building containerized or microservice-based systems

You need multi-region or multi-AZ control at deep level

🔵 Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)
Use When:

You are deploying containerized microservices

You want full control over networking, IAM, storage

You want to use Fargate (serverless containers) or EC2

You want simpler orchestration than Kubernetes

Avoid When:

Your team lacks Docker/container knowledge

You don’t need containers or microservices

🟣 Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
Use When:

Your team uses Kubernetes or needs a portable, cloud-agnostic container platform

You have large, complex microservices or multi-team dev ops environments

You need advanced features like:

Service Mesh

Custom controllers

Kubernetes-native tooling

Avoid When:

Your team has no Kubernetes expertise

You don’t need that level of control (ECS or Fargate is easier)

🟡 AWS Lambda
Use When:

You’re building event-driven, serverless workloads (e.g. API, S3 events, CRON)

You need to process small jobs: REST APIs, data transformations, etc.

You want to pay only for what you use (no idle cost)

Avoid When:

Your app is stateful or runs long (>15 minutes)

You need fine-grained control over runtime or networking

You have heavy-duty, complex services

⚠️ Things to Consider Before Choosing (For Production)
🔍 1. Operational Complexity
Elastic Beanstalk: Very simple

ECS: Medium (need Docker/container knowledge)

EKS: High (need Kubernetes and cluster ops knowledge)

Lambda: Very simple, but architectural change needed

📈 2. Scalability & Performance
Lambda: Scales almost instantly

ECS/EKS: Scales well but requires warm containers

Beanstalk: EC2-based, slower scaling

💵 3. Cost Control
Lambda: Most cost-effective at small scale

ECS Fargate: Predictable cost, no idle infra

EKS: More expensive to operate (EKS fee + infra)

Beanstalk: Cost tied to EC2 instances and related AWS services

🔐 4. Security & Isolation
All support IAM, VPC, encryption, etc.

EKS/ECS give more granular network & policy control

🔁 5. CI/CD Integration
All integrate with CodePipeline, GitHub, etc.

ECS/EKS allow complex release strategies (e.g., canary, blue/green)
