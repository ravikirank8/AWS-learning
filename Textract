🔹 What is Amazon Textract?

Amazon Textract is a document text extraction service.
Unlike OCR that just scans text, Textract also understands structure (forms, tables, key-value pairs).

📌 Think of it as OCR + AI → not only reads but also understands how data is organized in documents.

🔹 Features / Key Capabilities

✅ Extract Raw Text → Reads all printed text from scanned docs, PDFs, or images.
✅ Key-Value Pairs → Identifies form fields like "Name: Ravi", "DOB: 16-08-1995".
✅ Tables Extraction → Preserves rows/columns from invoices, spreadsheets, etc.
✅ Signature Detection → Recognizes whether a document has a signature box filled.
✅ Multiple Output Formats → JSON, CSV, TXT → easy to integrate into apps.
✅ Query-based Extraction → You can ask questions like “What is the invoice number?” and Textract will return the answer.
✅ Multi-Document Support → Works for scanned docs, PDFs, contracts, IDs, receipts.

🔹 How It Works (Simple Workflow)

Upload document (PDF, image, scanned file) to Amazon S3.
Trigger Textract using API or Lambda.
Textract processes → extracts text + structure.
Output delivered in JSON / CSV / TXT format.
Results can be further processed by Comprehend (to analyze) or stored in a database.

🔹 Example Workflow (Invoice Processing)
Vendor uploads invoice to S3.
Textract extracts:
Vendor Name
Invoice Number
Total Amount
Line Items in table format
Store results in DynamoDB.
Trigger Lambda to validate payment against ERP system.
👉 Saves manual data entry, reduces errors.
🔹 Real-World Use Case
Bank Loan Processing 🏦
Customer uploads ID, payslips, and application forms.

Textract extracts Name, Address, Income, Signature automatically.

Results fed into workflow system (e.g., Step Functions).

Loan officers only verify, not retype.

📌 Exam Tip: Textract is commonly paired with S3 + Comprehend + Lambda + DynamoDB.

🔹 Exam Mindset
