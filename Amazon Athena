🔹 Overview of Amazon Athena

Serverless, interactive query service that lets you query data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL (Presto/Trino under the hood).

No infrastructure to manage. You pay per query, based on the amount of data scanned.

Ideal for ad hoc queries, log analysis, lightweight analytics, BI dashboards.

👉 Exam hint: If you see “query S3 data using SQL without moving data into a database” → answer is Athena.

🔹 Athena Data Processing Workflow

Here’s the typical workflow when using Athena:

Data Ingestion into S3

Raw data stored in Amazon S3 (e.g., logs, clickstreams, IoT, CSV, JSON, Parquet).

Optionally ingested via Kinesis Firehose, Glue, or Lake Formation.

Schema Definition (Glue Data Catalog)

Define tables and schema (either manually in Athena or via AWS Glue Crawlers).

Metadata (columns, types, partitions) stored in the Glue Data Catalog.

Query with SQL

Run SQL queries in the Athena console, CLI, or JDBC/ODBC connections.

Example: aggregate, filter, join, or transform raw data.

Results Storage

Query results written back into S3 (can be in CSV, JSON, or Parquet format).

Visualization

Athena integrates directly with Amazon QuickSight for dashboards.

Can also connect to external BI tools (Tableau, Power BI) via JDBC/ODBC drivers.

🔹 Example Query

Suppose you have a dataset sales_data stored in S3 and registered in the Glue Catalog.

👉 Query:
SELECT product_id, SUM(purchase_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
WHERE purchase_date >= '2023-01-01'
  AND purchase_date <= '2023-03-31'
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;

📌 What this does:

Filters purchases between Jan–Mar 2023.

Aggregates total sales per product.

Returns top 5 best-selling products.

This is real-time ad hoc analytics on S3 data without moving into a database.

🔹 Features of Athena

Serverless → no cluster management.

SQL-based queries → easy adoption.

Pay-per-query → cost-effective (scans less = pays less).

Partitioning & Compression support → optimize queries with Parquet/ORC + partitioned S3 folders.

Secure → integrates with IAM, Lake Formation, and VPC endpoints for fine-grained access control.

Integration with Glue → uses Glue Data Catalog for schema discovery and metadata management.

Integration with BI Tools → QuickSight, Tableau, Power BI for visualization.

🔹 Real-Life Example

📌 E-commerce company analyzing clickstream logs

Logs from the website are streamed to S3 via Kinesis Firehose.

A Glue crawler catalogs schema (e.g., session_id, page_url, timestamp, user_id).

Analysts run Athena SQL queries:

Top visited pages in last 24 hours.

Abandoned cart analysis (users who added items but didn’t purchase).

Peak traffic hours by region.

Results are stored in S3 and visualized in QuickSight dashboards.

👉 This avoids spinning up a full Redshift cluster when only ad hoc queries are needed.

🔹 Exam Takeaway

If it’s about interactive queries on S3 without ETL/database → Athena.

If it’s about governance + centralized security for data lake → Lake Formation.

If it’s about ETL pipelines → Glue.

If it’s about data warehouse for structured queries & joins at scale → Redshift.
