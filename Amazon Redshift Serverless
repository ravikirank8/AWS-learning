 What is Amazon Redshift Serverless?
Redshift Serverless is a fully managed analytics solution where you can run SQL-based queries on large datasets without managing any infrastructure.
You don‚Äôt need to provision clusters or worry about node types ‚Äî AWS handles the scaling, availability, and performance behind the scenes.

‚ùìWhy Do We Need Redshift Serverless?
| Traditional Redshift Issue                      | Redshift Serverless Fix                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Need to size and provision clusters manually    | **Serverless autoscaling** handles capacity on demand        |
| Pay for idle time even if no query is running   | **Pay only when queries run** (no idle cost)                 |
| Difficult to predict capacity for new workloads | **Auto-adjusts capacity** based on query workload            |
| Requires more DevOps involvement                | **No infrastructure to manage**, ideal for analysts and devs |

üß† How Redshift Serverless Works
You define a ‚ÄúWorkgroup‚Äù: This is your Redshift endpoint for users and applications.

You configure base RPUs (Redshift Processing Units) ‚Äî the compute capacity baseline.

When a query is executed:

Redshift Serverless instantly provisions compute.

Uses Auto Suspend/Resume: suspends when idle, resumes on activity.

You are billed per second for query processing time (based on RPU usage).


‚öôÔ∏è Understanding RPUs (Redshift Processing Units)
1 RPU = 16 GB memory + vCPU + storage I/O power

Base capacity = Minimum number of RPUs provisioned (scale starts here)

Max scale-out = Dynamically allocates more RPUs if workload demands

You can configure 8‚Äì512 RPUs depending on expected workload size

üßÆ Example:
If you set 64 base RPUs, AWS ensures there's always 64 RPUs ready.
If your workload spikes, it can scale out automatically (to e.g., 128 RPUs).

üîß Configuring RPUs (Step-by-Step)
Workgroup Configuration

Set Base RPU Capacity (e.g., 32)

Define Max Concurrency Scaling settings

Auto Suspend/Resume

Idle timeout (e.g., 5 mins) after which it auto-pauses

Resumes on first query automatically

Network and IAM

Choose VPC/Subnet if needed

Assign IAM roles for S3, Glue, Athena integration
