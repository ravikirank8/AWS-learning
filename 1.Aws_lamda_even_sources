What is an Event Source in AWS Lambda?
Event Source iis that triggers  a Lambda function to run.

Lambda doesn’t run by itself — it needs an event from somewhere.

The event source sends data to Lambda when something happens, like a file upload or a message arriving.

Types of Event Sources
Push-based event sources:

These send events directly to Lambda.

Lambda is immediately triggered.

Example services: S3, API Gateway, SNS.

For example, when you upload a file to S3, S3 sends an event to Lambda to process that file.

Pull-based event sources:

Lambda polls the event source, checking for new data regularly.

Example services: SQS, Kinesis, DynamoDB Streams.

Lambda keeps asking, "Is there any new message or record to process?"

When there is, Lambda executes.

How Does It Work?
You configure Lambda to listen to a specific event source.

When an event happens, the event source sends the event data to Lambda.

Lambda receives this event as input and runs your code with that data.

Event Source Mapping (For Pull-based)
For services like SQS or Kinesis, Lambda doesn’t get pushed events.

Instead, Lambda sets up Event Source Mapping — this means Lambda polls the queue or stream for new messages.

When messages arrive, Lambda pulls them and processes.

Simple Example (S3 Bucket Trigger)
You create a Lambda function.

You set up your S3 bucket to send an event to Lambda whenever a new file is uploaded.

When you upload a file, S3 sends an event with details of the file to Lambda.

Lambda function runs automatically and can read/process the uploaded file.

Why Are Event Sources Important?
They connect Lambda with other AWS services.

They make Lambda event-driven — your code runs only when needed.

This allows for serverless automation and integration.
