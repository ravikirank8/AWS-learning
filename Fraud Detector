🔹 What is Amazon Fraud Detector?

Amazon Fraud Detector is a fully managed ML service designed to identify fraudulent activities (payments, fake accounts, fake reviews, identity theft).

AWS automates the data prep, model training, deployment → You just define rules + feed data.

It provides real-time responses in milliseconds → critical for fraud detection.

🔹 How Fraud Detector Works

Data Collection

Gather historical data: e.g., transaction logs, user login patterns, or review metadata.

Model Training

Fraud Detector uses ML + built-in fraud detection algorithms trained on Amazon’s global fraud detection expertise (from AWS & Amazon retail).

Rule Creation

You define rules (e.g., flag transaction if score > 80).

Combines ML scores + business logic.

Real-Time Prediction

New events (transactions, sign-ups, reviews) are scored in milliseconds.

High-risk ones get blocked or sent for manual review.

🔹 Setting Up Fraud Detector

Define Event Type → (e.g., payment, account sign-up, review submission).

Upload Data → CSV data into S3 (historical fraud/no-fraud events).

Train ML Model → Fraud Detector auto-selects the best fraud detection model.

Set Rules + Thresholds → Combine model scores + conditions.

Deploy Model Endpoint → Ready for real-time use via API.

🔹 Integrating with Client Applications

Fraud Detector exposes APIs → apps can call in real-time.

Example integration:

E-commerce checkout → Before payment confirmation, Fraud Detector checks the transaction.

Account creation → Checks if signup looks suspicious (IP, velocity, device fingerprint).

Content platform → Flags fake or abusive reviews.

🔹 Practical Example: Fake or Abusive Reviews 📝

Imagine an online marketplace (like Amazon or Yelp):

A user submits a product review.

Fraud Detector evaluates:

IP address reputation (is it from a bot network?)

User’s past behavior (sudden surge of reviews?).

Text metadata (duplicate wording, review velocity).

If the ML model detects fraud likelihood > 85% → review is flagged for human moderation.

Honest reviews pass through → protecting platform credibility.

🔹 Key Features (Exam Focus)

✅ Fully managed ML → no ML expertise needed.
✅ Real-time decisions (ms) → prevents fraud before damage.
✅ Customizable → You can combine ML predictions + business rules.
✅ Seamless AWS integration → S3 (data), CloudWatch (monitoring), Lambda (action automation), API Gateway (expose fraud API).
✅ Industry Use Cases:

Online payments → detect stolen cards.

Account sign-ups → detect fake accounts.

Reviews/comments → detect spam/fraudulent content.

🔹 Exam Mindset (Remember)

Keyword: Fraud detection with near real-time ML.

Different from Comprehend/Polly/etc. → It’s domain-specific for fraud use cases.

Workflow = Data → ML model → Rule-based thresholds → Real-time API → Action (approve/block/manual review).

✅ Think of Fraud Detector as a fraud firewall for apps:
AI + rules filter out suspicious activity before it causes loss.
