🔹 What is Amazon Rekognition?

A fully managed AI service for image and video analysis.

Uses deep learning models (pretrained, no ML expertise needed).

Serverless → you just upload images/videos to S3, Rekognition does the heavy lifting.

🔹 Key Features

Object & Scene Detection → Identify cars, trees, furniture, etc.

Facial Analysis → Detect faces, emotions (happy, sad, angry), age range, gender.

Face Comparison & Search → Compare faces across datasets (e.g., employee check-in systems).

Text in Images (OCR) → Extract text from road signs, receipts, documents.

Content Moderation → Detect explicit, unsafe, or inappropriate content.

Celebrity Recognition → Identify well-known public figures.

Custom Labels → Train Rekognition to detect business-specific objects (e.g., company logo, damaged parts in manufacturing).

🔹 Integration with Other AWS Services

S3 → Store images/videos.

Lambda → Trigger workflows (e.g., scan images as soon as they’re uploaded).

SNS / SQS → Notify when unsafe content is detected.

Athena/QuickSight → Analyze detection logs and visualize reports.

Step Functions → Automate review pipelines.

🔹 Real-Life Example (Production Use Case)

Imagine you’re building a social media platform:

Step 1: Upload → Users upload images/videos → stored in S3.

Step 2: Trigger → An S3 event triggers Lambda.

Step 3: Process → Lambda calls Rekognition:

Detects nudity/violence (content moderation).

Detects text in memes.

Detects faces for tagging.

Step 4: Decision:

If unsafe → store in “quarantine” S3 bucket and send SNS alert to moderation team.

If safe → publish content directly.

Step 5: Analytics → Store Rekognition results in DynamoDB or Athena, visualize reports in QuickSight.

👉 This setup ensures automated moderation at scale, but also allows manual review when confidence scores are below a threshold.

🔹 Exam Mindset (Key Points to Remember)

✅ Rekognition is serverless – no infra management.
✅ Best for real-time moderation, security, identity verification.
✅ Supports batch + real-time analysis.
✅ Confidence thresholds are important (too low → false positives, too high → false negatives).
✅ Can be integrated in streaming pipelines (e.g., Kinesis Video Streams).
✅ Security → use KMS encryption for stored media, IAM for access control.

👉 In exam questions, Rekognition usually appears when:

You need content moderation (images/videos filtering).

You need facial recognition for authentication or search.

You need text recognition in images without training your own ML model.
