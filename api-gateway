 What is AWS API Gateway?
API Gateway is a fully managed service by AWS that lets you create, publish, manage, and secure APIs. It acts like a “front door” to your backend services (like AWS Lambda, EC2, or other HTTP services).

🎯 Simple Analogy:
Think of API Gateway as a reception desk in a big company:

People (clients) ask for services.

The receptionist (API Gateway) checks if they’re allowed.

Then forwards the request to the correct department (backend).

Finally, sends the response back to the visitor.

✅ What is it used for?
| Use Case                   | Explanation                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Exposing Backend Services  | Create a unified entry point to call Lambda, EC2, ECS, etc.  |
| RESTful APIs               | Build and host REST APIs quickly.                            |
| Serverless Apps            | Connect to Lambda functions without managing infrastructure. |
| Request Routing            | Manage versions, stages (dev/test/prod), paths, etc.         |
| Authentication             | Add security (API keys, IAM, Cognito, JWT tokens, etc).      |
| Throttling & Rate Limiting | Avoid abuse or overload of your backend services.            |


📍 Where do we use it?
Use API Gateway when:

You want to expose AWS Lambda functions or microservices.

You’re building a mobile/web backend.

You need to control, authenticate, or monitor APIs.

You want to build a serverless architecture (e.g., with Lambda + DynamoDB).

You’re migrating from a monolith to microservices.


⚙️ How is it used?
1. Create an API
Choose: REST API, HTTP API (lightweight), or WebSocket API (real-time).

Define resources and methods (/users, GET, POST, etc.)

2. Connect to Backend
Link to Lambda, EC2, ECS, or other AWS services.

3. Enable Security
Add:

API keys

IAM permissions

Cognito user pools

JWT/OAuth2 authorizers

4. Deploy to a Stage
Example: dev, test, prod

5. Monitor and Manage
Use CloudWatch for logging, metrics, and tracing.

Enable caching or throttling if needed.



💡 Example Scenario
Use Case: You want to expose a backend Lambda function that returns weather data.

Steps:
Create an HTTP API in API Gateway.

Define a route /weather.

Link it to a Lambda function.

Secure it with an API key.

Deploy to a stage prod.

Call it from a frontend or mobile app:
👉 https://abc123.execute-api.aws-region.amazonaws.com/prod/weather


🧠 Important Technical Considerations
| Consideration            | Explanation                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type of API**          | REST vs HTTP vs WebSocket. Use HTTP for most modern apps (cheaper, faster). |
| **Latency**              | Adds minimal latency (\~20-50ms).                                           |
| **Pricing**              | Based on number of requests, caching, data transfer.                        |
| **Throttling**           | Set per-stage limits to protect backend.                                    |
| **Authorization**        | Choose between API key, IAM, Cognito, or Lambda authorizer.                 |
| **Caching**              | Use if data doesn’t change often — reduces cost & latency.                  |
| **Monitoring**           | CloudWatch logs + metrics.                                                  |
| **Versioning & Staging** | Use stages (`dev`, `test`, `prod`) for different environments.              |


🔀 Decision Tree: Do I Need API Gateway?
Are you exposing a backend service (Lambda, EC2, ECS, etc)?
 └── Yes ──> Do you want to control access, secure it, and scale easily?
                └── Yes ──> Use API Gateway
                └── No  ──> Direct access to backend may be enough

Are you building a real-time app (chat, live updates)?
 └── Yes ──> Use WebSocket API in API Gateway

Do you just want a lightweight, low-latency HTTP interface?
 └── Yes ──> Use HTTP API (newer, cheaper)

Do you need full REST features (like request transformations)?
 └── Yes ──> Use REST API (legacy but powerful)


✅ Best Practices
Use HTTP APIs if you don’t need advanced features (cheaper and faster).

Always enable authentication (Cognito, IAM, JWT).

Use staging and versioning properly.

Apply rate limiting and caching to avoid cost and overuse.

Monitor with CloudWatch and set alarms.

Use custom domain names for production.
