Database
üîç What Are Relational and Non-Relational Databases?
| Type                                | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Relational Database (RDBMS)**     | Structured, table-based database with predefined schema.                                          |
| **Non-Relational Database (NoSQL)** | Schema-less or flexible schema; stores data in key-value, document, graph, or wide-column format. |

üè† Real-Life Analogy
Imagine running a grocery store.
üßæ Relational DB = Structured Ledger Book
Like a neatly organized register:
Every sale entry has predefined fields: Date, ProductID, Price, CustomerID.
Easy to run reports like "Total sales by customer in June".
But adding a new field (like ‚ÄúCustomer's Favorite Brand‚Äù) requires schema change.

üì¶ Non-Relational DB = Flexible Whiteboard or Sticky Notes
Like a collection of sticky notes:
Each note (or document) stores flexible info:
One customer record has Name, Email, LoyaltyPoints,
another has Name, Email, Address, Birthday, Preferences.

Great for fast, flexible input/output ‚Äî not great for complex joins.
üß† Key Differences
| Feature         | Relational DB (RDS, Aurora) | Non-Relational DB (DynamoDB, DocumentDB) |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Schema**      | Fixed (tables/columns)      | Flexible or schema-less                  |
| **Structure**   | Rows and columns            | JSON (Docs), Key-Value, Graph, Column    |
| **Best For**    | Structured, related data    | Unstructured or semi-structured data     |
| **Scalability** | Vertical (bigger server)    | Horizontal (more servers)                |
| **Examples**    | MySQL, PostgreSQL           | DynamoDB, MongoDB, Redis                 |
| **Joins**       | Supported                   | Not supported (or limited)               |
| **Use Case**    | Banking, ERP, CRM           | IoT, e-commerce carts, logs              |

üß∞ When to Use Each (as Solution Architect)
‚úÖ Use Relational When:
Data relationships are important (e.g., Customers ‚Üí Orders).
Need for ACID transactions (banking, accounting).
Queries require joins or aggregations.
Structured reporting & analytics.

Examples:
E-commerce: Orders, customers, inventory.
HR or Finance system.
Booking platforms with normalized data.

üß© AWS Services:

Amazon RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle)
Amazon Aurora (MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible)

‚úÖ Use Non-Relational When:
Data structure is dynamic or semi-structured (no fixed schema).
Need to scale massively (horizontal scaling).
High write/read throughput (real-time apps).
Low latency is critical.

Examples:

Real-time chat apps (user ‚Üí messages).
IoT devices pushing time-series data.
Gaming user profiles, session tracking.
Product catalog with varying attributes.

üß© AWS Services:
DynamoDB (Key-Value / Document)
DocumentDB (JSON document store like MongoDB)
Amazon Neptune (Graph DB)
Amazon ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached) for caching
If the question mentions flexible schema, millisecond performance, serverless scaling ‚Üí DynamoDB.
If it mentions ACID transactions, strong consistency, complex joins ‚Üí RDS/Aurora.
Use Aurora Serverless for cost-efficient relational DB with auto-scaling.

E-Commerce Application:
| Feature           | DB Type                            | AWS Service   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Users & Orders    | Relational (joins needed)          | Amazon RDS    |
| Shopping Cart     | Non-relational (fast, schema-less) | DynamoDB      |
| Product Catalog   | Non-relational (flexible fields)   | DynamoDB      |
| Inventory Updates | Relational (transactions)          | Amazon Aurora |
| Search            | Specialized (full-text)            | OpenSearch    |

‚úÖ Relational Database Example:
üí° Example: Online Bookstore
üîó Structure:
Tables (with relationships):
Customers table: CustomerID, Name, Email
Orders table: OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate
Books table: BookID, Title, Author, Price
OrderItems table: OrderID, BookID, Quantity

‚úÖ We use joins to relate CustomerID to their Orders, and each order to its Books.

üìò Real-World Scenario:
"Show all books bought by Ravi in the last 6 months."
Requires structured schema and joins.
üìå AWS Service:
‚û°Ô∏è Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL/Oracle)
‚û°Ô∏è Amazon Aurora

‚úÖ Non-Relational Database Example:
üí° Example: User Profile and Activity Feed (Social App)
üß± Structure:
No tables ‚Äî instead, each user profile is a document (e.g., JSON):
{
  "user_id": "123",
  "name": "Ravi",
  "email": "ravi@example.com",
  "interests": ["music", "tech", "books"],
  "last_active": "2025-07-24T13:00:00Z"
}
Each document might have different fields.

‚ùå You don‚Äôt need rigid schemas or complex joins. Just retrieve entire documents quickly.

üìò Real-World Scenario:
"Get Ravi's profile and preferences in < 10ms."
Needs fast access and flexible structure.
üìå AWS Service:
‚û°Ô∏è Amazon DynamoDB
‚û°Ô∏è Amazon DocumentDB (if JSON documents like MongoDB)

===============================================================================================================================================================



Amazon RDS is a managed service for setting up, operating, and scaling relational databases in the cloud ‚Äî without managing infrastructure.
‚úÖ You get: Automatic backups, patching, failover, high availability, and scalability.

üìò Why Do We Need RDS?
Without RDS, you'd:
Manually install and patch the DB engine
Set up HA (replication, failover)
Take backups
Monitor performance

With RDS, AWS handles all of the above ‚Äî you just focus on your data and application logic.

ü§î How to Choose the Right RDS Database Engine
‚úÖ Consider These Questions:
Are you migrating from on-prem?
Stick with existing engine (Oracle, SQL Server)

Is your app open-source friendly?
Go with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MariaDB

Do you need cloud-native performance?
Use Amazon Aurora

Heavy IOPS workloads?
Use io1 storage or Aurora

Compliance requirements?
Use RDS with encryption, IAM, logs, and VPC

| Application Type             | Recommended RDS Engine      | Notes                                   |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| WordPress, Drupal, Magento   | MySQL or MariaDB            | Easy, fast setup                        |

| SaaS, Microservices          | Amazon Aurora               | Auto-scaling, high-availability, modern |
| Data Lake or Analytics       | PostgreSQL + Redshift combo | PostgreSQL for staging                  |


üéØ AWS Solution Architect Tips
Use Multi-AZ for HA, not for read scaling
Use Read Replicas for performance scaling
Choose Aurora when you need performance + durability and are not locked to vendor
Use gp3 storage unless you need high IOPS
Know Blue-Green deployments for zero-downtime DB releases
Use RDS Proxy for serverless or Lambda access
Encrypt RDS at rest & in transit using KMS and SSL

üß† AWS Solution Architect Exam Tips
RDS = SQL + managed; Aurora = scalable, cloud-native SQL
DynamoDB = NoSQL with near real-time response + serverless
Redshift = Used only for analytics, not transactional apps
ElastiCache = Caching layer, used to reduce DB load
Aurora Serverless v2 = Scales instantly based on demand
Use DynamoDB TTL, Streams, DAX (cache) for advanced use cases
DocumentDB = MongoDB-compatible but not open-source
