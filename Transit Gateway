🚀 What is AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)?
AWS Transit Gateway is a network transit hub that connects VPCs, on-premises networks, and other AWS services through a single gateway.

✅ It supports transitive routing and centralized control, solving all scalability issues of VPC peering.

                      VPC1 VPC2 VPC3
Central hub = TGW

Spokes = VPCs, VPNs, DX

Transitive routing enabled: VPC1 ↔ VPC2 ↔ VPC3

Single place to control routing

Works across accounts (using RAM)

🧠 Key Concepts
| Concept               | Description                                                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attachment**        | A connection between a VPC or VPN and the Transit Gateway             |
| **Route Table**       | Each TGW has its own route tables; VPCs can use specific route tables |
| **Propagation**       | Automatically adds routes to the TGW route table                      |
| **Association**       | Tells TGW which route table to use for the attachment                 |
| **Domain Isolation**  | You can control who talks to whom using route tables                  |
| **Multicast support** | For real-time apps (VoIP, media streaming)                            |
| **Cross-account**     | Yes, through **AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)**                    |

🔗 Connecting On-Premises Networks to TGW
You can attach on-premises to TGW via:

| Method                                | Use Case                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **VPN (IPSec)**                       | Site-to-site connection                        |
| **AWS Direct Connect Gateway (DXGW)** | Dedicated private connection                   |
| **SD-WAN appliances**                 | 3rd-party integrations (e.g., Cisco, Aviatrix) |
🧠 This means you can connect data centers → TGW → all VPCs.

🔁 Transit Gateway Peering (TGW Peering)
Allows TGW-to-TGW connection across regions/accounts

Works over AWS backbone – not over the internet

Fully managed & encrypted

Use case: Global architectures (e.g., US ↔ India)

⚙️ Advanced Connectivity Options
| Feature                  | Description                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inter-Region Peering** | TGWs in different regions can talk                       |
| **Multicast**            | App-level support for media or broadcast                 |
| **Bandwidth control**    | Support for bandwidth throttling in attachments          |
| **Appliance Mode**       | For routing traffic through firewall appliances          |
| **Centralized NAT**      | You can place NAT Gateway in one VPC and share it across |

💲 Transit Gateway Pricing
| Pricing Component        | Cost (approx)                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Per attachment**       | \~\$0.05/hour                      |
| **Data processing**      | \~\$0.02 per GB                    |
| **Inter-region peering** | \~\$0.02–\$0.05/GB based on region |
✅ No per-VPC peering cost → scales better

🔐 Security Considerations
| Area              | Best Practice                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Route control** | Use multiple TGW route tables to segment environments |
| **IAM Policies**  | Control who can create/attach VPCs to TGW             |
| **Flow Logs**     | Enable logging for auditing and monitoring            |
| **RAM Access**    | Grant limited cross-account attachment rights         |
