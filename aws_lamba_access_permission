| Permission Type       | Purpose                             | Example                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Execution Role (IAM)  | What Lambda can do during execution | Read S3, write CloudWatch logs |
| Resource-based Policy | Who/what can invoke Lambda function | Allow API Gateway to invoke    |

Access permissions define what your Lambda function is allowed to do and who can invoke it.

“Synchronous invocation is like a phone call — the caller waits for you to answer.

Asynchronous is like sending an email — the caller sends it and moves on, and you respond later when ready.”

AWS Lambda pricing is based on how many requests you make and how long your code runs, depending on the memory and compute power you allocate.
You pay only for what you use—no servers, no pre-purchased units.
