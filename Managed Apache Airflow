üß† What is Amazon MWAA (Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow)?
Amazon MWAA is a fully managed orchestration service for Apache Airflow on AWS.
Airflow is an open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows as DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs).

Think of MWAA as:
A workflow manager that automates complex, multi-step data or application pipelines using Python scripts.

üé¨ Real-World Analogy
MWAA is like a movie director who:

Knows which actor (task) does what and when.

Ensures the right scenes (steps) are executed in the correct order.

Can reshoot failed scenes (task retries).

‚öôÔ∏è Key Components of MWAA / Apache Airflow
| Component                        | Description                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** | A workflow defined in Python. Shows task dependencies.                 |
| **Operators**                    | Define what each task does (e.g., BashOperator, PythonOperator, etc.). |
| **Tasks**                        | A single unit of work (runs a script, API call, query, etc.).          |
| **Scheduler**                    | Decides when each task should run based on DAG and dependencies.       |
| **Executor**                     | Responsible for running tasks (e.g., CeleryExecutor, LocalExecutor).   |
| **Web UI**                       | Visual dashboard to monitor workflows, logs, and errors.               |
| **Metadata Database**            | Stores DAG runs, task status, logs, etc.                               |
| **Environment**                  | AWS-managed setup with IAM, S3 (for DAGs), and VPC networking.         |

‚úÖ Why Use MWAA?
You need to schedule and monitor workflows or pipelines.

You want to run data engineering or ETL jobs.

You need to orchestrate jobs across multiple AWS services.

You want a scalable, highly available, secure managed Airflow environme

üß† Exam Tips (for Solution Architect):
MWAA is best for teams familiar with Apache Airflow.

MWAA is used to orchestrate multi-step, conditional workflows that need to run in a defined order.

Compared to Step Functions, MWAA:

Is code-driven (Python).

Supports complex branching logic and custom plugins.

Is better for data pipelines, while Step Functions is better for serverless app orchestration
