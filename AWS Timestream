üìå What is AWS Timestream?
Amazon Timestream is a serverless, fully managed time-series database service optimized for collecting, storing, and analyzing time-stamped data at scale.

Think of it as the CloudWatch Logs of metrics ‚Äî but built specifically for time series analytics, e.g., IoT sensor data, application metrics, DevOps monitoring, or industrial telemetry.

ü§î Why Use a Time Series Database?
üß© Problem with Traditional Databases:
General-purpose relational DBs (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) are not optimized for high-ingestion, timestamped, sequential data.

Time series data:

Is append-heavy

Requires complex retention policies

Needs fast aggregation over time windows

Traditional DBs perform poorly under such requirements and lack efficient storage formats for time-based trends.

‚úÖ How AWS Timestream Addresses These Challenges
| Challenge                               | Timestream Solution                                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High ingestion of time-stamped data** | Purpose-built storage engine handles millions of writes per second         |
| **Retention complexity**                | Automatic tiered storage: memory ‚Üí magnetic based on configurable policies |
| **Slow queries for trends**             | Built-in time-series functions (windowing, smoothing, interpolation)       |
| **Manual scaling needed**               | Fully **serverless**, scales automatically with load                       |
| **Data aging**                          | Native aging policies move data to cheaper storage                         |

üß† Core Concepts & Architecture
üîÑ Storage Tiers:
Memory Store: Optimized for recent (hot) data, fast queries

Magnetic Store: Cost-effective for long-term (cold) data

Retention Policies: Define how long data stays in memory vs magnetic

üí° Partitioned Model:
Data is organized by:

Databases

Tables

Dimensions (like tags: region, device_id)

Measures (values being measured: CPU %, Temp)

Timestamps
