Amazon EC2 is a foundational AWS service that provides virtual servers in the cloud (called instances) to run your applications.

In simpler terms, EC2 lets you rent compute capacity (CPU, memory, network) by the hour or second, scaling up and down dynamically.

üß© 2. Core Components of EC2
| **Component**                   | **Description**                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**  | Pre-packaged template for launching instances (OS, apps, configs). Example: Amazon Linux 2023 AMI. |
| **Instance Types**              | Different combinations of CPU, RAM, network, storage optimized for workloads.                      |
| **Instance Purchasing Options** | On-Demand, Reserved, Spot, Savings Plans. (More later.)                                            |
| **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**   | Persistent disk storage attached to instances.                                                     |
| **Instance Store**              | Ephemeral (temporary) storage physically attached to the host. Data lost when stopped.             |
| **Security Groups**             | Virtual firewall controlling inbound/outbound traffic.                                             |
| **Key Pairs**                   | SSH credentials for login.                                                                         |
| **Elastic IP**                  | Static public IP address.                                                                          |
| **Placement Groups**            | Control instance placement for performance (Cluster, Spread, Partition).                           |
| **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** | Distributes traffic across multiple instances for high availability.                               |
| **Auto Scaling Groups**         | Automatically launch/terminate instances to meet demand.                                           |
| **CloudWatch**                  | Monitoring and logging metrics.                                                                    |
| **User Data**                   | Bootstrap script that runs on first boot (e.g., install packages).                                 |


üè∑Ô∏è 3. Instance Types and Families
EC2 offers many instance families. Think of them like car types‚Äîsedans, trucks, sports cars‚Äîoptimized for different uses.

Here are the main families:

| **Family**                | **Optimized For**               | **Example Use Case**                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **General Purpose**       | Balanced compute/memory/network | Web servers, app servers (t3, t4g, m5, m6i) |
| **Compute Optimized**     | High CPU performance            | Batch processing, gaming servers (c6i, c7g) |
| **Memory Optimized**      | High RAM                        | Databases, analytics workloads (r6i, x2idn) |
| **Storage Optimized**     | High disk throughput or IOPS    | Data warehousing, NoSQL (i4i, im4gn)        |
| **Accelerated Computing** | GPUs or FPGAs                   | ML training, video rendering (p4, g5, f1)   |

Solution Architect Tip:
Always choose instance types based on workload profiles. Use Compute Optimized for CPU-bound workloads, Memory Optimized for large in-memory datasets.

| Pricing Model               | Description                     | When to Use                      | Cost Efficiency         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **On-Demand**               | Pay per hour/second             | Unpredictable workloads, testing | üí∞üí∞üí∞ (most expensive) |
| **Reserved Instances (RI)** | Commit for 1 or 3 years         | Stable, long-term workloads      | üí∞ (up to 72% savings)  |
| **Spot Instances**          | Bid unused capacity             | Fault-tolerant, batch jobs       | üí∞üí∞ (up to 90% off)    |
| **Savings Plans**           | Flexible commitment for compute | Changing instance types/families | üí∞ (up to 66% savings)  |
| **Dedicated Hosts**         | Physical server reservation     | Compliance, licensing control    | üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞ (highest cost) |
