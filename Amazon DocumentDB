üìò What is Amazon DocumentDB?
Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) is a fully managed NoSQL document database service. It‚Äôs designed for JSON-like document storage and optimized for read-heavy, scalable workloads.

üß† While it supports the MongoDB API, it's not running the MongoDB engine. Instead, it's built on a purpose-built distributed architecture by AWS.

üß± DocumentDB Architecture Overview
‚öôÔ∏è Key Architectural Components:
| Component             | Description                                                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cluster**           | Logical grouping of one **primary instance** and **0+ replicas** (up to 15)       |
| **Primary Instance**  | Handles **write operations** and read if needed                                   |
| **Replica Instances** | **Read-only** nodes that asynchronously replicate from primary                    |
| **Storage Volume**    | Decoupled, automatically growing, fault-tolerant, and **shared across all nodes** |
| **Cluster Endpoint**  | Routes to the primary instance (for write operations)                             |
| **Reader Endpoint**   | Routes to all replicas (for read scalability)                                     |
üß† Unlike MongoDB, storage and compute are decoupled. So, scaling instances doesn‚Äôt affect data persistence, and storage auto-scales up to 128 TiB.

üåç Global Clusters (Multi-Region Support)
DocumentDB Global Clusters replicate data across AWS regions, enabling:

Disaster recovery

Global low-latency reads

Cross-region replication

Global clusters use asynchronous replication across regions while still ensuring durability within each region using multi-AZ architecture.

üöÄ Key Features and Benefits| Feature                   | Benefit                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MongoDB Compatibility** | Supports MongoDB 3.6, 4.0, and 5.0 APIs (drivers/tools reuse) |
| **High Availability**     | Multi-AZ deployment with automatic failover                   |
| **Scalability**           | Read scaling with up to 15 read replicas                      |
| **Storage Auto-Scaling**  | Automatically grows up to 128 TiB                             |
| **Fully Managed**         | No patching, backups, or replication management               |
| **Security**              | Encryption at rest (KMS), VPC, IAM, TLS in transit            |
| **Monitoring**            | Integrated with CloudWatch, Performance Insights              |

üì• Read Preference Options (Client-side Optimization)
Amazon DocumentDB supports the same read preference modes as MongoDB, helping to balance latency and consistency
| Read Preference      | Description                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `primary`            | All reads go to the primary instance (strong consistency)                    |
| `primaryPreferred`   | Reads prefer primary but fallback to a replica if primary is unavailable     |
| `secondary`          | Reads are routed only to replica nodes (eventual consistency, lower latency) |
| `secondaryPreferred` | Prefer replicas but fallback to primary if no replica available              |
| `nearest`            | Read from the **lowest-latency** node (could be primary or secondary)        |
üìå Choosing the right mode impacts latency, availability, and read consistency. For global clusters, nearest can be used to route reads to the closest region.

üß† Real-Life Analogy
Imagine DocumentDB as a library system:

The primary librarian handles all new book entries (writes),

Multiple assistant librarians help readers find books quickly (replicas for reads),

The storage room auto-expands as you add more books (decoupled storage),

You can ask for a book from the nearest librarian (read preference = nearest),

Even if one librarian is unavailable, others take over without data loss (multi-AZ)
